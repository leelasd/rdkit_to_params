# RDKit to params
Create or modify Rosetta params files (topology files) from scratch, RDKit mols or another params file.

## Rationale
This is a fresh rewrite of ``mol_to_params.py``. For three reasons:

* I cannot share my 2to3 port and modded module-version of ``mol_to_params.py`` due to licence.
* I want to modify `params` files and more as opposed to use a standalone script.
* RDKit does not save ``mol2`` files, yet knows about atom names and Gasteiger-Massilli charges and more...

It sounds mad, but did not actually take too long.

## Caveat: I do not know many things!

### Chemical
I suspect I am doing stuff weirdly and I am meant to create ligands via ``pyrosetta.rosetta.core.chemical`` and not via params files... If this is so let me know. I don't mind knowing I made a mistake!

### Generic
I like this generic atom type business, but I am not sure how to use them in RL.
``from_mol(mol, generic=True)`` will make generic atom types.
I made several guesses with the classic atom types and I am sure many things are wrong...

### Rings and cis-trans
I don't know what `CUT_BOND` does. I think it is to do with rings.
`ADD_RING` is not implemented in the `from_mol` conversion as I think it's an old command.
Does a cis-trans tautomer bond (say `C(=O)-C=O`) gets a `CHI` entry? I am assuming no, but not sure.

## Roundtrip
Native amino acid params files can be found in the Rosetta folder
`rosetta/main/database/chemical/residue_type_sets/fa_standard/residue_types/l-caa`
Let's do a roundtrip changing an atomname:

    import pyrosetta
    pyrosetta.init(extra_options='-mute all')
    from rdkit_to_params import Params
    
    p = Params.load('PHE.params')
    p.IO_STRING[0].name3 = 'PHX'
    p.IO_STRING[0].name1 = 'Z'
    p.AA = 'UNK'
    del p.ROTAMER_AA[0]
    p.rename_atom(' CB ', ' CX ')
    p.dump('fake.params')
    p.test().dump_pdb('test.pdb')

## From mol object
### Requirements
For the sake of sanity, `EmbedMolecule`, `Chem.AddHs(mol)` or any weird hack is assumed to have been done beforehand.
And that the user is going to do `Chem.MolToPDBFile(mol)` or `Chem.MolToPDBBlock(mol)` _afterwards_.

The molecule should preferably be **not** Kekulised.
3letter name of residue is either from the title row (``_Name``) if a 3letter word or from the PDBInfo or 'LIG'.

Dummy atom (*/R) is assumed to be a CONNECT —ligand only atm.

Here is a conversion:

    import pyrosetta
    pyrosetta.init(extra_options='-mute all')
    # note that pyrosetta needs to be started before rdkit.
    from rdkit_to_params import Params
    from rdkit import Chem
    from rdkit.Chem import AllChem
    
    mol = Chem.MolFromSmiles('NC(Cc1ccccc1)C(=O)O')
    mol = AllChem.AddHs(mol)
    display(mol)
    AllChem.EmbedMolecule(mol)
    AllChem.MMFFOptimizeMolecule(mol)
    
    Params.add_names(mol, names=['N', 'CA', 'CB', 'CG', 'CD1', 'CE1', 'CZ', 'CE2', 'CD2', 'C', 'O', 'OXT'], name='LIG') 
    p = Params.from_mol(mol)
    p.NBR_ATOM.append('CB')
    p.NBR_RADIUS.append('12.3')
    p.test().dump_pdb('test.pdb')
    Chem.MolToPDBFile('ref.pdb')

For more see [autogenerated documentation](sphinx-documentation.md). Sphinx with markdown cannot deal with typehinting,
so checking the code might be clearer.

## To Do
I have not coded yet, because I forgot:
* ~~an auto-assignment of `NBR_ATOM` and `NBR_RADIUS` for `from_mol`.~~
* add rotamer line in `from_mol`
* change option to override starting atom.
* tweak the logic of `NAME` after some thinking.
* ~~output constrain file for the CONNECT atom.~~
* make a webpage to do the conversion from mol/sdf/pdb/SMILES —suggestions for free JS molecule editor?

## Workshop

The `from_mol` class method actually has code that recognises `*[NH]CC(~O)*` and assigns it as a backbone properly.
However, `Chem.MolFromSmiles('*[NH]CC(~O)*')` cannot be embedded, so is a bit of a horrible one for users to use.
Maybe the `CC(=O)NCC(=O)NC`
